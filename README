Niwa (Japanese for 'garden') is a collection of interesting C++ projects,
written in 2009-2010. It mostly demonstrates larger-scale (25 KLOC) C++
development, with careful decoupling and documentation (doxygen). The code
is organized as a single Visual Studio solution containing multiple projects
(which can be either executables, static libraries or dynamic libraries).

The main executable in the project is demoengine, which uses lua scripting to
dynamically load, configure and present demo effect libraries (fx_dynamics,
fx_graphics, fx_levelset, fx_raytrace). The demo effects in turn rely on
various statically compiled libraries (e.g., graphics, levelset, raytrace,
photonmap).

This public version only contains source codes. Namespaces and folder
structure correspond one-to-one as in Java. I have removed third party
projects, namely boost, freeglut, libjpeg and lua (with lambda extension).
I have also removed Visual Studio project and solution files, since they
were quite convoluted due to version migrations.
